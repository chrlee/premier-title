  <h2>Our History</h2>

  <p>Premier Title & Settlement Co. has been meeting the needs of clients in an efficient manner from contract to closing since 2006. Working with both local and national realtors and lenders, we have grown into a full-service closing agency examining title issues and providing title insurance to residential and commercial properties, refinances, home equity loans, new construction, and 1031 exchanges.</p>

  <p>Maryann K. Lee is a certified Title Agent with more than 15 years of experience in the examination of title insurance policies and overseeing settlements. Stephen H. Lee and Sung C. Chun are practicing attorneys with more than 50 combined years of experience in real estate law and serve as general counsels to Premier.</p>

  <p>Knowing that the title work and closing have been entrusted to individuals with hands-on experience, and also having direct access to counsel from an experienced real estate attorney are some of the benefits our clients receive when selecting us as their title company. Whether it is a property with title issues, closing on a residential short sale, or a complicated buy/sell business or commercial deal, our clients have the reassurance of closing in a law office so that our attorney can clarify matters related to real estate, title, and the different types of tenancy on deeds, as needed.</p>

  <p>Serving Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia, Premier has been delivering top-notch customer service and we will continue to meet your expectations. For more information or a quote of our fees, please email or call us at 703-658-7007.</p>
