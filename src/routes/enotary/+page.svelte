  <h2>Electronic Notary Service</h2>

  <section>
  An eNotary is a Notary Public who notarizes documents electronically. One of the methods employed by eNotaries is the use of a digital signature and digital notary seal to notarize digital documents and validate them with a digital certificate. Electronic notarization is a process whereby a notary affixes an electronic signature and notary seal using a secure Public key to an electronic document (such as a PDF or Word document). Once affixed to the electronic document, the document is rendered tamper-evident, making unauthorized attempts to alter the document evident to relying parties. The e-notary will use cryptography and Public Key Infrastructure to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke the digital certificate. The Electronic Notary must also keep an electronic register of each act performed.

  In most cases, electronic notarizations do not mean that the notary can perform electronic notarizations remotely, as most states still require that the participants and the notary must all be physically present at the time of signing. There are also significant benefits to having notarizations done electronically, such as cost savings, superior security, authenticity, audit trails, and document integrity, which are not available in paper-based notarizations.
